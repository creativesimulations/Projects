===================================

1. Attach the "Derender" script to an object in the main scene.
2. Attach the "DerenderSensor" script to an object which will activate and deactive the nearby renderers.
3. Set the trigger collider on this object to the desired size.
4. Attach the "RendererToggle" script to all objects that you want to toggle the renderers on.
