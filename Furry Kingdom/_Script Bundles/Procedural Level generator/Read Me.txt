Instructions how to use the Procedural Level Generator
=======================================

1. Add the "ProceduralLevelGenerator" script to an object in the scene.
2. Set the maximum number of terrain tiles desired, the maximum height and width (horizontal).
3. Set the maximum water tiles desired.
4. Set the x and y offests for the tiles.
	The x offest is determined by the width of the tiles.
	The y offset is determined by the jump height of the player.
5. Set where the level should begin generating from. The default is 0,0,0;

6. Attach the "LevelTerrainTiles" script to the same game object.
7. Attach all desired NavMeshSurface components to the same object.
8. Add all of the terrain prefab variations that you want to the LevelTerrainTiles lists and set their maximum heights.
	The lowest tiles should be the water tiles, next the grass tiles, then desert tiles, forest tiles and mountain tiles should be the highest.

9. Add the "OffMap" script to a child of the same game object. This notifies the player that it has fallen off of the map and needs to be reset.
10. Set the box collider size and location to encompase the x and z axis of the entire map and as far below the map as desired.
11. Add the "TileManager" script to an object that you want to be the parent of all of the level terrain tiles.
