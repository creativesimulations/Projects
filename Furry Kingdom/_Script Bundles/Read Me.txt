This is a fairly new project that I began at my sons request.
We wanted to play a fun game together, but haven't been able to find a fun quality game that we can play together locally with friends.
So I began coding this small local multiplayer game.
It it loosely based on the old game Q-Bert.
Each player has a baby dragon that tries to control the most tiles be changing the tile flags to your color.
You need to defeat animals to get their abilities and get stronger.
To win, you need to collect the most tiles, find the King of the Hill tile and stay on it until the timer runs out!
I've added ReadMe files to each of the folders explaining how to use the various scripts.
