# Epic-Ball
My first Android game

Epic Ball was my first full Android game which I recently refactored. This was the main project I worked on while first learning C# and Unity, so my code was really bad at first. The game now runs smoother after refactoring, and the code is much clearer and properly documented! You can see a video of a trailer that I made for the game here: https://youtu.be/kqxvZaCsNvM?feature=shared
Aside from the camera shake scripts, all of the code is my own.
