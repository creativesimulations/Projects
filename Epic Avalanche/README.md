# Epic Avalanche

This repository is to showcase some of my older code and other files related to a previous project called 'Epic Avalanche'. You can see the video that I made in Unity with this code here: https://youtu.be/_nfBnJch8fQ?feature=shared
I did use a purchased asset to shatter the snow models into chunks for the avalanches, but otherwise all of the code is mine. Aside of course, from Unity mechanics such as the splines that I used for the camera movement.
