# Kingdoms At War

This repository is to showcase some of my older code from previous projects of mine. You can see the youtube video that I made in Unity with this code here: https://youtu.be/soW71PrhARM?feature=shared
I did use a purchased asset to shatter the islands into chunks, but otherwise all of the code is mine. Aside of course, from Unity mechanics such as the splines that I used for the camera movement.
